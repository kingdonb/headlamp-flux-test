## WIP

Headlamp Flux (testing)

Please refer to the official Headlamp documentation

### Known Issues

* On OpenShift, as a project/tenant
  * Your project admin does not have permission to list namespaces, crds, etc.
  * Headlamp is apparently not (yet?) designed to operate in a single namespace
  * Ref: [headlamp-k8s/headlamp#2342](https://github.com/headlamp-k8s/headlamp/issues/2342)
